# Nexora (NEX)

Nexora (NEX) is a decentralized ERC-20 token powering a secure, transparent, and community-driven ecosystem.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure-First Approach

Nexora is built with an infrastructure-first mindset.

Rather than optimizing for announcements or short-term narratives, the focus is on:
- reducing execution friction
- improving reliability under real-world conditions
- enabling systems that can be pressure-tested and iterated in production
Infrastructure is validated by real usage, load, and failure modes — not by claims. 
This philosophy guides Nexora’s development, security posture, and roadmap.
